"""

###### 1. Commenting. ######

"""
  Commenting is an important part of good code. It should not be overdone, but it should
  also help a reader of your code understand what is going on.

  Using the three " is actually creating a string that can go over multiple lines, we
  will expand on that in a later tutorial but for now just know it's a nice way to highlight
  comments.

  The standard way to comment code is with the # operator. This is how I will primarily
  do it.

  Keep in mind that a lot of comments can sometimes make it more difficult to understand,
  it's a balancing act. From my experience it's usually better to have too much rather than
  not enough.
"""
# Throughout these templates I will try to comment as much as possible to ensure you
# can complete the tasks, however, if something is not clear I recommend that you
# add comments to the code that will help you understand in the future.

"""
  ###### 2. the print function ######
"""
# A)  Your first task is to print Hello World! again using either " or '

print("Hello world")

# B)  Can you separate the words and print them individually?
#     Below is the print function
#     print(*objects, sep=' ')
#       *objects  - any number of inputs to be printed.
#       sep       - how are we separating the inputs? Default is space.
#     There are others but for now let's concentrate on these two.
#     From this try and use multiple inputs to the print function i.e. print( 'hello', 'world!' ).
#     what is the result?

print('hello', 'world!')

#     Now let's try with a different separator, try whatever you like,
#     print( "hello", "world!", sep='+' )

print('hello', 'world!', sep = '+')


# C)  Can we print other things other than strings?
#     and can we combine different things?
#     print an integer and a float separately

#print() # int
#print() # float

#     now try and print a string, an integer, and a float in the same print function.

print('fÃ¼nf', 5, 5.0) # string, int, float

"""
  ###### 3. Creating Variables ######
"""
#     How do we create variables?
#     Variables are used to store pieces of information such as strings, integers,
#     floats and a number of other things.
#     A variable name can contain upper or lower case letters, digits and the underscore _,
#     but, they cannot start with a number... If I can make one suggestion, try to make
#     your variable names easy to follow, i.e.
#     firstname = 'Michael'
#     surname = 'Halstead'
#     BUT! You have to be careful with what you call things, as certain names already
#     exist i.e. don't call something float = 'string' as float is an inbuilt python
#     object. You will start to know more of these as the semester continues, but
#     for now understand that it will cause problems if you overwrite something.
# A)  lets create a number of variables storing a string, an integer, and a float.
#     You can create any number of these, an example: str0 = 'Hello'

print( 'EXERCISE 3A')
str0 = "Hello"
a = 5
b = 5.0
print("Done.")
# B)  Now can you print these variables??

print( 'EXERCISE 3B' )
print(str0, a, b)

"""
  ###### 4. Arithmetic ######
"""
#     Python has some basic built in maths functions.
#     +   addition
#     -   subtraction
#     *   multiplication
#     /   division
#     **  power i.e. 2**3 = 8
#     //  floor division i.e. 3/2 = 1
# A)  Use each of these mathematical expressions and print the result

print( 'EXERCISE 4A')

print(a**b)

# B)  Try to use variables in these expressions.
#     i.e. x = 13
#          y = 3
#          z = x // y
#          print( z )

print( 'EXERCISE 4B')
x = 13
y = 3
z = x//y
print(z)


"""
  ###### 5. boolean operators ######
"""
# These operators are essentially True or False values that can be used for a number of things in python.
# One of the most common uses is if statements which we will cover later.
# A) Print the two types of boolean values (True or False) remember it is a capital letter at the start.
#    Create a variable of each value and print them too.

print( 'EXERCISE 5A')
t = True
f = False
print(t, "or", f)
# B) Creating from statements.
# you can also create booleans by using statements that would create a true or false situation.
# this can include bool_var = 5 > 4
# in this case if 5 is greater than 4 you would return True else it would be False.
# the following statements can be used:
# x==y  : x is equal to y
# x>y   : x is greater than y
# x<y   : x is less than y
# x>=y  : x is greater than or equal to y
# x<=y  : x is less than or equal to y
# x!=y  : x is not equal to y
# create two variables, x and y and assign them with numerical values.
# Using the above statements to output True or False values based on these variables.

print( 'EXERCISE 5B')
print(x==y)

"""
  ###### 6. and or operations ######
"""
# An extension of exercise 5 are the 'and' and 'or' operators.
# you can create a single boolean variable from a number of boolean operators.
# left and right   : both the left and the right side must return True else this outputs a False.
# left or right    : either the left or the right must be True for the function to output a True.
# A) create three variables (x, y, and z) and assign them numerical values.
#    use the operators from 5B to create True or False values based on these created variables using "and" or "or".
#    print the output.

print( 'EXERCISE 6A' )
x = 10
y = 5
z = 2
print("x == z*y and x/z == y: ", x == z*y and x/z == y+1)
print("x == z*y and x/z == y: ", x == z*y and x/z == y)

# B) the 'not' operator: essentially converts a False to a True
# x and not y means that if y is False then it becomes True
# not x and y means that if x is False it becomes True
# Use the variables from 6A and create a variable using the not operator

print( 'EXERCISE 6B' )
print("x == z*y and not x/z == y: ", x == z*y and not x/z == y)
print("x == z*y and not x/z == y: ", x == z*y and not x/z != y)
"""
  ###### 7. the if statement ######
"""
# If statements are a very handy programming tool that compares a boolean operator and if it's true will inact some code.
# the general idea is:
# if <something is True>:
#   <do something>
# elif <something else is True but not the thing on the "if" line>:
#   <do something else>
# elif .... (can have any number of these)
# else:
#   <catch all statement to do something>
# In the first line we try to get a True result from an operator i.e. x > y
# if this isn't true we try the elif command i.e. x == y
# Finally if none of the previous statements are true we go into the "else"
# Three really important things to keep in mind.
#  1. You must end the control line with ":" if you don't you will get errors. Try it below.
#  2. Indentation is very important!! After the control statement you MUST tab or space in! If you don't
#     you will get errors, try it below. Keep in mind that pycharm should automatically does this unless you changed something.
#  3. You can't leave the inside of an if statement empty. i.e. where I have <do something> you must do something!
# A) create a basic if statement using your variables from Exercise 6, just do a single compare function and just the if
#    (i.e. don't worry about elif or else):

print( 'EXERCISE 7A' )
if x == y * z:
    print(True)

# B) Now use the same control statement and create an elif and else to go with it.
# play around with this so it goes into the different parts of the if statement.

print( 'EXERCISE 7B' )
import random
schroedinger = random.randint(0,2)
if schroedinger == 1:
    print(True)
elif schroedinger == 0:
    print(False)
else:
    print("None")

# C) Now let's use multiple control statements in a single if (i.e. if x<y and x>z etc.)

print( 'EXERCISE 7C' )
if x == z*y and x/z == y:
    print(True)

"""
  ###### 8 lists, dictionaries, and tuples ######
"""
# lists, dictionaries, and tuples are storage classes that allow you to store all different types of information
# in an array like fashion.
# They are very very handy objects that we will use a lot in this course, particularly lists!
# In python please keep in mind that we start storing information at index 0. I will explain later why this is
# so important but it's good to keep in mind that the first element of a list and tuple is not index = 1 it is index = 0

###### 8A basics of a list
# lists are literally what they sound like, a basic object that can store lists of information. This can be any
# information and any combinations of information.
# 8A-1 Create two empty lists, you can do this with the l=[] brakets or by invoking l=list()

# empty list
print( 'EXERCISE 8A-1' )
note = list()
print("Done.")
# 8A-2 lists with something in them... use the [] brackets and create 2 lists with at least three elements in them.
# l = [1,2,3]
print( 'EXERCISE 8A-2' )
note = [3]
note.insert(0, 1)
note.append(2)
print(note)
# A handy method with lists  is the ability to create a list with N of the same elements
# x = [3]*3 try it now with either strings, floats or ints
note = note * 3
print(note)
# 8A-3 lists also come with some inbuilt methods that do various things.
# lst[0] gets the 0th element, keeping in mind that this is the first element.
#       we can substitute 0 for any index that exists within the list.
# lst.append( 3.14 ) will add 3.14 to the end of the current list! This is very handy if you want to add stuff to a
# list at the end.
# lst.insert( index, 3.14 ) will insert 3.14 at the specified index, remember this index has to be inside the existing list.
# lst.pop( index ) will remove the value at index from the list, once again index must be within the current list.
# try using each of these tools.

print( 'EXERCISE 8A-3' )

note.insert(0, 1)
note.append(2)
note.sort()
print(note)

####### 8B basics of a dictionary
# Dictionaries are another inbuilt storage class. However, instead of using an index in the same way that lists do
# dictionaries must have a key:value pair, where the key is how you index.
# 8B-1 You can create empty dictionaries in the same way that you would lists but instead of the [] you use the {} and
# the dict(). Try it now.

print( 'EXERCISE 8B-1' )
dit = dict()
dit1 = {}
print(dit == dit1)


# 8B-2 the interesting thing about dictionaries is that the key can be a string or a number.
# {'first':1, 2:2, 'three':'dog'} you can see in this example that I have used either a string or a number.
# Pay close attention to how I assigned the key and value pairs, there is a : between the two!
# You try this, create a dictionary with at least three key:value pairs.

print( 'EXERCISE 8B-2')
dit = {1:"cool",2:"notcool"}
print(dit)

# 8B-3 In much the same way as lists we can alter dictionaries.
# dit[key] where key is one of the keys in the dictionary will return that value in the key:value pairs.
# dit[key] = value will change the value at key to the new value. Or if the dictionary exists it will add a new key:value
#                  pair
# dit.pop( key ) will remove the key:value pair assigned to key from the dictionary
# dit.update( {key0:value0, key1:value1} ) will update the dictionary with the new information or add elements if they
#                                           aren't already there.
# Try each of these in turn.

print( 'EXERCISE 8B-3' )
print(dit[1])
print("Pop:", dit.pop(2))
dit[1] = "new"
print(dit[1])
dit[1] = "new"
print(dit)

###### 8C basics of a tuple # immutable
# Tuples are the final inbuilt storage object we will be teaching you here.
# they are very similar to lists apart from one very key difference. Once they are created you can not easily alter them.
# This is a very handy property of tuples at different times so keep it in mind.
# 8C-1 Create an empty tuple. (This isn't overly practical but it's good to know)
# like lists and dictionaries you can create emtpy objects with list() or ()
# You should notice that we have used all sorts of brackets now.
# Create empty tuples

print( 'EXERCISE 8c-1' )
emptytuple = tuple() # or ()
print(type(emptytuple))
# 8C-2 Now let's create tuples.
# First thing to keep in mind if you want a single item tuple you need to insert a comma after the first variable.
# If you don't do this it will just return a string, float, integer, etc. Try it now.

print( 'EXERCISE 8C-2' )
tpl = (2)
print(type(tpl))
# 8C-3 Now let's create a tuple with at least 3 elements. Again you can put whatever you want in there.

print( 'EXERCISE 8C-3' )
tpl = (1,2,3)
print(tpl)

# 8C-4 Finally, like previously mentioned you can not directly manipulate a list. Try it using the same ways that we tried
# with lists and dictionaries?
# If you want to manipulate a tuple you need to convert it to a list first
# lst = list( tup )
# lst**do manipulations
# tup = tuple( lst )
# Obviously not very convenient and if you plan on manipulating a tuple maybe it's better to use a list?
# the only thing that still works is accessing a tuple index (just can't change it):


print( 'EXERCISE 8C-4' )
print(tpl.index(3))
lst = list(tpl)
print(tpl)
print(lst)
lst.pop(1)
print(tuple(lst))

"""
  ###### 9 basics of numpy ######
"""
# numpy is a library that we included in our environment. It stands for numerical python.
# it allows us to work with vectors and matrices and do a number of things.
# The first thing we must learn when using external libraries (those that aren't standard in python) is that we have
# to import them. In this case we are going to import the numpy library.
# You can do this in two ways, it really depends on you:
# import numpy # this will import all libraries and when you call numpy you must use the full library name i.e. numpy.array()
# import numpy as np # is a standard nickname for numpy, the difference is that instead of using the full name (numpy) you
# only have to use np i.e. np.array().
# This choice is completely up to you. For this course we will be using "import numpy as np"
# Usually you would put this at the top of the file, but for now it's okay to do it here.
# Either way let's import it now.



# 9A Creating vectors and matrices from a list
# The first way that we will learn to create a matrix array is from a list.
# create a vector of length N
# x = np.array( [1,2,3, ..., N] ) # here is a list inside a np.array function call which converts to a vector.
# what you should notice is that the list inside the function contains only 1 dimension.
# now create a vector using the above command and print the shape of the vector to the screen x.shape
# keep in mind that the list should contain numbers in this case...

print( 'EXERCISE 9A' )
import numpy
def random_vec(n, value_range):
    lst = [random.randrange(1, value_range, 1) for i in range(n)]
    vec = numpy.array(lst)
    return vec
print(random_vec(100,100))

# now we will create a matrix
# So the above only had a single dimension, but sometimes we want to work with matrices.
# i.e both a row and a column dimension. We can do that using a list by simply adding the second
# dimension as a set of [] brackets

# x = np.array( [[1,2,3]] ) print out the shape too?
print(numpy.array([random_vec(100,100)]))

# what about if I want the dimensionality switched? How do we do that? [[],...,[]]
vec = numpy.array([random_vec(100,100),random_vec(100,100),random_vec(100,100),random_vec(100,100)])
print("Four random vectors as array: \n", vec)

print("vec * vec: \n", random_vec(100,100) * random_vec(100,100))

# you can also do this with the x.T operator (transpose)
print("Transposed:\n", vec.transpose())


# what if we want a 3x3 dimension matrix?
# see if you can work that out using the above formation?
mat = numpy.array([[1,2,3]]*3)
print(mat)
# And can we manipulate these arrays?
# we can access these in the same way we would access a normal matrix: x[row,col]
# we can display the values and print the values. Try this with all three of your np arrays, keep in mind the first
# one was a vector...
mat[1,2] = 5
print(mat)
# what happens if you created a matrix/vector of integers but now you want to insert a floating point number? Try it
mat[1,2] = 5.125
print("No change after inserting a float:\n",mat)

# how do we fix that?
mat = numpy.array([[1.,2,3]]*3)
mat[1,2] = 5.125
print("Create new Matrix:\n", mat)

# or alternatively change the type?
mat = mat.astype(float)
mat[1,2] = 5.125
print("Or better, change type:\n", mat)


## 9B mathematical operations.
# Numpy works in much the same way as normal mathematical operations but in this case you can do it on vectors and
# matrices.
# try to perform basic value math on what you created.

print( 'EXERCISE 9b')
mat = mat * 5
print("Matrix * 5:\n", mat)
print("mat / 2 + 12:\n", mat / 2 + 12)

## 9C matrix operations.
#  numpy can also work with matrices and vectors for vector operations.
# things like multiplication, and dot product are there, along with sum, mean, max, min operators.
# first let's use multiplication on the previous matrices, remember dimensions have to hold so if
# you need to create new ones do it now.

print( 'EXERCISE 9C' )
mat0 = (mat + 2.5)**2 * 1.43
mat1 = (mat / 0.2 + 2) * 6
print("+\n", mat0+mat1)
print("-\n", mat0-mat1)
print("*\n", mat0*mat1)
print("/\n", mat0/mat1)


# We can also perform row or column wise operations.
# In this case x[3,3] and y[1,3]or[3,1] what happens if we perform mathematical operations on x using y?
# Try an array of both [1,3] and [3,1] what happens? What do you see?
mat0 = numpy.array([[1,2,3]])
mat1 = numpy.array([[1],[2],[3]])
mat2 = mat0 * mat1
print(mat2)

# You can do this with all the maths operations. This is handy knowledge to have in your toolkit for later.
# now let's look at the dot product
# mo (1x3) m2 (3x3) output should be 1x3
# d = np.dot( mat0, mat1 )
vec = [1,2,3]
vec1 = [3,2,1]
print("Dot product (1x3 * 1x3):\n", numpy.dot(vec, vec))
print("Dot product(3x3 * 1x3):\n", numpy.dot(mat2, vec))
print("Cross product:\n", numpy.cross(vec,vec1))


# there are a number of other functions available. You can find these by researching the numpy site or just using google
# in general. Here are a couple more:
# x = mat.mean() # mean of the matrix
# x = mat.sum() # the summation of the matrix
# x = mat.min() # the minimum value in the matrix
# x = mat.max() # the maximum value in the matrix.
# Try them out now.
print("Mean: ", mat2.mean())
print("Sum: ", mat2.sum())
print("Min: ", mat2.min())
print("Max: ", mat2.max())

# Any Questions?
